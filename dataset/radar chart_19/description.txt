This radar chart showcases the relative strength of different book categories within a library's loan management system. Two series are represented: "Loan Count" (blue) and "Overdue Count" (red).

The chart highlights the following trends:

- **Fiction** is the most popular category with a significantly higher loan count than other categories. It also stands out as a high outlier.
- **Children's books** have a consistently high loan count, indicating their popularity among younger readers.
- **Biography** has the lowest overdue count, suggesting books in this category are generally returned on time. This is highlighted as a low outlier.
- **Science and Technology** categories have a similar loan count, suggesting comparable demand.
- **Overdue counts** generally remain lower than loan counts, indicating a reasonable return rate for most categories.

This chart provides a valuable visual representation of book loan trends within the library. The presence of outliers effectively emphasizes noteworthy categories requiring further attention for optimization, such as increasing availability for high-demand categories or exploring solutions for overdue management in less popular categories.
