This radar chart visualizes the monthly expense distribution across seven categories: Rent, Food, Transportation, Entertainment, Utilities, Healthcare, and Other. The chart presents data for four consecutive months, allowing for trend analysis.

Generally, there is a slight downward trend in overall expenses from Month 1 to Month 4. However, individual categories show distinct patterns. For instance, Transportation expenses are highest in Month 1 and show a consistent decrease over the following months.

A notable outlier occurs in Month 2, where Healthcare expenses are significantly higher than other months. This outlier suggests a potential medical event or unexpected cost during that period.

Comparing the months, Rent and Food remain relatively stable, while Entertainment and Utilities show a decreasing trend. It's important to note that while the overall expense decreases, some categories might experience fluctuations due to individual circumstances.
