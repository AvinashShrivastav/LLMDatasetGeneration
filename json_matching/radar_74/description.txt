This radar chart analyzes the gift shopping list for a festive event, comparing the expected quantity of items with the actual quantity purchased. The chart reveals several key trends. Overall, the actual quantity of most items is significantly higher than expected, suggesting an overstocked situation. 

A notable outlier is "Drinks," where the actual quantity is significantly higher than anticipated. This could be due to a last-minute decision to purchase extra drinks or an overestimation of the number of guests. 

While most categories show a higher than anticipated purchase, "Games" and "Entertainment" are closer to the expected quantities. This indicates that the planner was more accurate in their estimations for these categories.

The chart highlights the importance of accurate planning and forecasting for events to avoid overstocking and potential waste.
